# README

A real-time forum built from the ground up (no scaffolding) with no JS (only turbos_treams) + Bootstrap v5 and rails 7, and some interesting features :

- Fat models, skinny controllers
- Counter caching models
- Class scopes
- Shared form partials with locals
- Current.user class
- to_param method instead of FriendlyId
- N+1 reduction
- Pagination with [Pagy](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy)
- In-app and e-mail notifications with [Noticed](https://github.com/excid3/noticed)
- Brodcasting callbacks
- Sourced (renamed) associations (When the name you want to use for an association on the model isn't the same as the assocation on the :through model, you can use :source to specify it.)
- â€¦and more!
